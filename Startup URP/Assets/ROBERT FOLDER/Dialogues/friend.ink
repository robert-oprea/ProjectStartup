- Hola, mija. It's good to see that you made it here well. What can I help you with?
* I heard you have a granddaughter my age.
Ah, mi Camila, the sunshine of my days. She has a heart as warm as freshly baked conchas, and her kindness knows no bounds. She's always outside, so I have no doubt you'll see her around.
* Can I help you with anything? #startQuest:quest_on
I'm craving some fresh fruits from Luis' store. Would you mind going there to get me some? I won't give you a list, just pick whatever catches your eye the most.
* Tell me a bit about this place.
Ah, mi vida, let me share the magic of our gem with you. The colorful houses along cobblestone streets, flowers dancing in the breeze. The plaza is our heart, filled with lovely people and the scent of fresh fruits from Luis' store.
    -> END
