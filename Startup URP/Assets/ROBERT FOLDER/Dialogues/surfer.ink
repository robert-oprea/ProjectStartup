- Oh, hi there! You must be Sophia.
 * How did you know?
 * That's me!
 
- Camila told me you were coming to visit our litle town.
* Yes, it's really pretty.
* I'm starting to love it

- Great, I'm from here either so I know it must be difficult at first to get around here without knowing the language. So whenever you'll feel like practicing a bit of Spanish, let me know!
* Then let's get to it!
* I will, but I want to take a look around first. Thank you so much!

    -> END
