- Oh, my darling, I'm so glad you're here. I have a special box for you. Let me try to remember where I put it.

* A box? What’s in it?
* What kind of box?
    
- Now, now, no need to rush. Good things come to those who wait. You remind me of myself when I was your age—always in a hurry, always busy, rarely taking the time to slow down. Time, my dear, is one of the most precious treasures in this life.

* Sorry, Grandma, you know I don't like surprises.
I understand, dear, but something tells me you'll like this one. In my youth, I traveled the world far and wide. From each place, I brought something special. Now that I'm a bit too wise to revisit those spots, I believe this will mean more to you than to me.

* I know, grandma, you've told me this already
I know dear, and yet you don't seem to listen to my advice. Don't worry, though, I have not told you this story before. In my youth, I traveled the world far and wide. From each place, I brought something special. Now that I'm a bit too wise to revisit those spots, I believe this will mean more to you than to me.

-

* These are postcards! Really old ones!
* Uhh, postcards?

- Not just any postcards, my dear. These postcards are from all the places I've visited. I made sure to choose ones that capture the essence of each place the best. A little bird told me you're turning into quite the adventurer, so I thought it's time to pass this on to you. You can enjoy all the incredible places on this Earth through these postcards.

* Grandma, these postcards are incredible! I can’t believe how many stunning places you’ve visited!  I’m so happy to have you sharing these stories with me.
Each postcard holds a piece of the story I wish to share with you, but keep in mind that most have changed since I last visited them. While buildings can change from year to year, something that doesn't change in a lifetime is the culture. So wherever you go, appreciate the small things each place has created and cherished.

* There are so many postcards with so many different places. Tell me about them!
Oh dear, I'm so happy you're liking them. This one, from Paris, reminds me of the charming little patisserie where I had the best croissant of my life. And this one is of a small town in Spain. Looking at them brings back so many good memories. But I believe much has changed since I last visited them. While buildings can change from year to year, something that doesn't change in a lifetime is the culture. So wherever you go, appreciate the small things each place has created and cherished.

-

* Absolutely, Grandma! I promise to bring you back the most incredible postcards from my adventures!

- Listen, my dear. Before you plan anything I want you to do one thing for me. Every journey needs to have a start, so close your eyes, and tell me where your heart tells you to go.

* I always wanted to go to Spain. It is such a beautiful country but I know nothing about it.

- Then, that's your opportunity to learn as much about it as your heart desires. After all these years, I still send letters to the lovely friends I've made in Spain. Many of them have grandchildren that are around your age. I will send a few letters and I'm sure I'll get you the perfect person to show you the beauty of Spain.
