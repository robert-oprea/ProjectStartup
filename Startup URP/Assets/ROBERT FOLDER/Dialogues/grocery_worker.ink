- Hola, debes de ser Sohpia. Camila me dijo que estarías por aquí.

 * Hola. I still have to work on my Spanish skills
 * Sorry, I don't speak Spanish
 
- Oh, my bad. Camila did not tell me you don’t speak Spanish. I said that she told me you’d be around. What brings you to my little store?
  
* I need to buy a little bit of something. Maybe this will also help me learn a few words
* I heard that your fruits are the best in the area.
You're right. Let's take a look.

    -> END
