- Hola, debes de ser Sohpia. Camila me dijo que estarías por aquí.

 * Hola. I still have to work on my Spanish skills
 * Sorry, I don't speak Spanish
 
- Oh, my bad. Camila did not tell me you don’t speak Spanish. I said that she told me you’d be around. What brings you to my little store?
  
* I don't really know for sure
Hmm, then maybe Camila's grandmother needs something. Due to her age, Camila does the groceries for her.
-
*I'll go check then

    -> END
